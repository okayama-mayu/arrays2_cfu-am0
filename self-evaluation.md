# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel pretty confident about it. The one thing I'm starting to worry about is the fact that I'm able to do it, but I need to reference my notes a lot. I'm worried I'm not memorizing/internalizing some of the code.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I didn't really have an Unproductive struggle per say. I did somehow miss the lesson on how to test our Ruby code from Atom in the Terminal, so I'm worried I'm rushing and missing chunks of our lessons.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still want to practice and learn pair coding. I need to internalize some of my notes and make sure I memorize the content a bit more so I'm not so reliant on my notes. I need to take time tonight to look over my notes and do this.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
My only question right now is where the lesson on testing Ruby code is. I posted on our small group channel and will look over the Mod0 content again.
